- I rewrite the for loop. It will start from 0
- The software run sucessfully in the machine
- However, the result is not correct. The value are too large
- Then, I rewrite the loop to let the program output peak-peak value. Ma checks the value and tells me all of them are correct
- Then I find I just add all of the values but forget to divid the groups
- After modifying, the program could output the normal value
