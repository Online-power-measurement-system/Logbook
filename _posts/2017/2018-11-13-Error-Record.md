- Still cannot run
- The system of machine in the laboratory is Win7. The dll files are incomplete, I cannot install them one by one
- But the program produced by VC6.0 could run successfully
- I will not use Visual Studio 2017. It will upgrade the dll automaticly sothat the software canot run. Use VC6.0 is a more smart choice(Although ugly and old).
