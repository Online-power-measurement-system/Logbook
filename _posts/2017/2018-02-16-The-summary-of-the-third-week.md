## Summary of Week’s Activities

- Solve the problem of real-time face recognition.
- Write the code for Raspberry Pi to drive LED lights.
- Run the program which can recognize the face and control LED lights.

## Problem encountered and solutions

- In the beginning, the system cannot shoot the video and recognize the human’s face at the same time. Finally, we find some information from the Internet and modify the code to solve this problem.
- We try to combine the code of controlling LED and recognizing face. However, there is a problem that when the camera has recognized a face, the LED is light, but the display of camera is stuck. This problem now we can’t solve it.


## Achievement in this week

- We connectd to the wireless network sucessfully. It means that we need not use the network cable anymore.
- We found the problems in our code and solve them by searching in the Internet. It helped us to grasp the operating instructions.
