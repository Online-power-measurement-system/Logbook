## Ideas
- The frequency(50Hz) and period(20ms) are stable
- The maximum sampling rate of DSO2090 is 100Msa/s
- Hence, we could use 2M points to represent one cycle


## Problems
- The sampling rate of DSO2090 cannot reach 100Msa/s
- Only 25004 sets of data one second
- The obtained data is inaccurate for one cycle
