## Summary
I try to delete the Liss figure and power log in interfece directly. There are so many bugs at first. Depend on the error log, I find so many variables which should be deleted together. Moreover, I delete the functions which could output figure and the corresponding classes. After that, the program could run. This is the first steo to modify the program.
