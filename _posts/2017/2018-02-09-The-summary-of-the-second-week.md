## Summary of Weekâ€™s Activities

-	Install the OpenCV library function.
- Modify the system files to connect to the wireless network.
- Run the test code which we have writted before.

## Problem encountered and solutions

- When we installed the OpenCV library function, we found the CPU was in high load. We had to use the fan to cool down the chip.
- The code could not run for there are over three errors. After searching the answers in goole, we debugged it.

## Achievement in this week

- We connectd to the wireless network sucessfully. It means that we need not use the network cable anymore.
- We found the problems in our code and solve them by searching in the Internet. It helped us to grasp the operating instructions.
