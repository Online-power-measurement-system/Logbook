- This software is based on VC6 with MFC libraries. VC6 is a old platform and MFC is difficult to use.
- It is necessary to rewrite the dll file which is used for DSO2090 if user want to change the IDE
- The algorithm is not perfect because the sampling rate is not enough
- The program is difficult to understand since there are only a little comments.
