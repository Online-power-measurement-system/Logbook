## Summary
- Have a general understanding of plasma.
- Two types plasmas
- Non-thermal plasmas could produce high-energetic electrons effectively without excessively heating the gas 
- The high-energetic electrons are able to generate reactive species which are promising for modifying chemical kinetics and increasing the chemical reaction rates 
- That's why we need to study non-thermal plasmas
