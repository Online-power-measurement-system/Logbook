- The program still cannot run.
- I modify the core code to let the software just output the read data. Then, we find the software work sucessfully. It means the problem is the core algorithm.
- After several attempts, I lock the problem at for loop. If the start condition is j=start, the program will quit. Then I realize the program cannot find the specific start point. That is the most critical issue!
- I need to rewrite the algorithm
