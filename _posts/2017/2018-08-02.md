## Summary
- Supervisor give me a new task, I need to modify the code to measure the power of gliding arc discharge.
- The original software is used to measure the power of DBD. So I need to change the algorithm.
- Task: literature review(about how to calculate the power of GAD)
- Find some jounals and paper on the website. I will read them after a few days.
## The names of paper
- Gliding arc gas discharge", Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 
- Plasma Parameters of a Gliding Arc Jet at Atmospheric Pressure Obtained by a Line-Ratio Method
- Analysis of Discharge Sound and I-V Characteristic on Gliding Arc Discharge
- DISCHARGE CHARACTERISTICS OF GLIDING ARC PLASMA REACTOR WITH ARGON/NITROGEN
- The electric characteristics for the coaxial DBD plasma actuator
